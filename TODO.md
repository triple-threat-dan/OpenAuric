Current issues:
- [x] In the UI, instead of displaying the session ID in the ARCHIVES panel, display the session name, and default the session name to the (truncated) first line/few words of the first prompt of that session.
- [x] Change communion/live communion in the ui to terminology that is less occult-ish.
- [x] Display session name and id somewhere in the modal popup in the logs page
- [x] llm/agent responses from discord don't show up in other areas such as the UI. They also seem to create a new session each time, unless I'm hallucinating? Instead of appending to the current session. Expected: the auric UI should show user and agent messages from ALL sources/pacts, and discord messages from auric should be appended to the current session, and the chat messages form the current session should be sent to the llm as a conversation history.
- [x] the discord integration should only trigger the llm to respond if the agent's bot is tagged, replied to, or their name is mentioned (store agent/assistant name in the json)
- [x] her cli tools might not be working, and check that they run in the workspace folder by default
- [x] I don't think the chat assistant is actually creating sub-agents when needed, check how that works and verify that the RLM pieces are coded correctly
- [x] need a mascot/logo and UI revamp. ALISS is the mascot, in a wizard's hat!
- [x] the agent is just saying a tool call instead of actually... calling that tool
- [x] architect a way for the agent to build new incantations when it needs to
- [x] add a tool call to allow the agent to run arbitrary powershell commands
- [x] github integration
- [x] gemini cli integration
- [ ] emotionsss. small model, runs every prompt or task, a global json state of the emotions, a method to inject that state into the system prompt for each call to the LLM
- [ ] have the heartbeat logic update the emotional state too (gradually calm the agent)
- [ ] I am not sure that heartbeats are working. Let's add a table called heartbeats to the database and log them there. Let's also add an auric heartbeat command so you can manually trigger one from the cli.
- [x] Daily memories aren't implemented? And need to be... `yyyy-mm-dd.md`, should be saved when important events happen. Perhaps after every interaction a small model is loaded up to summarize recent events and pick important bits to append to the file
- [x] allow multiple discord users to talk to aliss by having the user messages be prepended with the name of the sender so she knows which user(s) she's talking to
- [ ] a re-runnable onboarding process via the cli that allows users to set tokens, select pacts, set the name of the agent, etc. 
- [x] actual vector db for long term memories
- [x] add support for searching/googling (Brave integration)
- [x] give the agent the ability to make new spells and save them
- [x] previous session should load when the user opens the app instead of a new session automatically
- [ ] support sending images to the agent
- [ ] support sending multilines in the chatbox
- [ ] auric -m "send a message from the CLI"
- [x] I think auric might have problems with the workspace, perhaps move workspace and install dir to a subfolder in the app directory
- [ ] fix it so I don't have to do python -m auric.cli anymore and can just do auric <command>
- [ ] look into auric status
- [x] add support for asking the agent to remember something, having it write to its memories, etc.
- [ ] add support for receiving images from the agent
- [ ] add support for sending files to the agent
- [ ] add support for receiving files from the agent
- [x] SECURITY. Add token for the frontend ui.
- [x] SECURITY. Add pairing for discord integration.
- [ ] add support for specialist agents/models for the rlm to call (coding specialists, RP/chat specialists, etc.)
- [ ] sessions still aren't closing when I am trying to force them to. We need to review how sessions are routed, especially from DMs to general chats and vice-versa. 
- [x] logs... we need to log *everything*. We need an everything log that logs every single tool call, chat, response, llm call, etc. in JSONL format.
- [ ] need to add a config/settings page on the frontend ui to allow users to configure their pacts, tokens, etc. Basically a UI for the json config.
- [ ] We need to add a way to search the logs and memories, perhaps ui pages 
- [ ] Add per-file unit tests for all the modules, get test coverage above 80%
